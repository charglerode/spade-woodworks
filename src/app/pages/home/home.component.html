        Every piece is hand-made, from wood selection, to joinery, to final
        finish. We take great care in building every piece and you can be sure
        that each one is as unique as the craftsman.

        We use 100% solid, domestic, non-endangered hardwood in all of our
        pieces. We don't use plywood, particle board, or any other manufactured
        woods. We also don't use any glues or finishes that are toxic or contain
        dangerous solvents.
