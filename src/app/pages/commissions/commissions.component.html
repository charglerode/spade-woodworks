    <h1>Commissions</h1>
    <p>
      All items in our storefront can be customized to your specifications. If
      you would like a customized version of a product, please do not purchase
      directly from the storefront. Instead, contact us through our contact form
      with details about your request. We will provide you with a general quote
      and an estimated completion time based on the level and type of
      customization you require.
    </p>
    <h2>Custom Products</h2>
    <p>
      If you are looking for a completely custom piece of furniture, we invite
      you to reach out via our contact form. This will initiate our
      pre-production process, during which we will discuss your vision, gather
      specifications, and provide a quote. Once you receive the quote, a 25%
      deposit is required before we begin the design phase.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
      During the design phase, we will refine your ideas based on your
      specifications and create an initial design. We will maintain open
      communication throughout this process and share the design with you for
      review. You may request modifications, which our craftsman will
      incorporate into the final version. At this stage, we will provide a final
      quote and an estimated completion timeline. Once you approve, we will move
      forward with production.
    </p>
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>
      In the production phase, our craftsman will carefully select wood, process
      the lumber, and complete the joinery, assembly, and finishing of your
      piece. We will provide periodic updates and can share progress photos upon
      request. Depending on the complexity of your design, production may take
      anywhere from 1 to 4 months or longer.
    </p>
    <h2>Completion & Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Once your piece is completed, we will notify you, and the remaining
      balance must be paid before delivery. Smaller commissions will be shipped
      directly to you, with shipping costs included in your original quote.
      Larger furniture pieces may require freight shipping, which will also be
      reflected in your quote. If you are located in Southern Nevada, we offer
      complimentary hand delivery by our craftsman at no additional cost.
    </p>
    <p>We look forward to building your vision!</p>
